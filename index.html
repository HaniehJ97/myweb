                    The library in Amsterdam is a modern architectural masterpiece, designed with the younger generation
                    in mind.
                    Its sleek exterior is dominated by large glass windows, allowing for plenty of natural light. The
                    atmosphere
                    inside is warm and inviting, especially on rainy days, with raindrops gently running down the glass.
                    The
                    surrounding area includes green spaces and bike racks, a common sight in Amsterdam, where students
                    can park
                    their bicycles before entering the library.
