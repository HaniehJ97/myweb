    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>

        The library in Leiden offers a harmonious blend of modern and historical architectural styles, making it an
        appealing destination for the younger generation. It features large windows that bring in natural light,
        even on overcast, rainy days. The exterior is framed by bike racks, where students can leave their bicycles
        as they enter the building under their umbrellas. Inside, the library has a minimalist design, with an
        emphasis on functionality and comfort. Bookshelves are neatly organized with a wide array of books, from
        classical literature to modern publications. The library offers quiet reading areas for those seeking focus and
        concentration, as well as group study spaces for collaborative work. The warm lighting and calm environment
        make it an ideal place for study or casual reading.</p>
